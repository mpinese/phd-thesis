* CPVs: 
  - Received from Clare Watson on 4 Nov 2014.  Notes from Clare:
    The data looks really tight for the key data points you specified (Tumour size, Lymph nodes, 
	Margins, Staging, Recurrence/Outcome data) but just a reminder that only the ICGC cohort has 
	been thoroughly audited.  Please note that the grading system for Neuroendocrine tumours (if 
	you are to include them in your analysis) differs from the system used for PDACs; grading of 
	Neuroendocrine tumours is based on mitotic count, Ki-67 staining and tumour size.  Also take 
	note of 2142, a cholangiocarcinoma that is staged as a carcinoma of the intrahepatic bile 
	duct, and 3345 which is a PDAC collected from a liver resection.
* GEX:
