Chapter 2:
* Was there a relationship between metagenes identified and location/grade?
* What pre-operative treatment did patients receive?
* Add discussion on how filtering only on survival-associated genes could introduce bias and limit discovery of networks.
* "Why only include metagenes associated with decreased survival?  Were there any metagenes associated with increased survival?"
* Pg 16, Pa 3: Expand on 'lenient selection parameters'
* Pg 27: How do results compare to histopathology (eg do high proliferation signature samples also have high Ki67, do high EMT have loss of Ecad?).  Discuss relevance to lab testing by IHC.
* What other hallmark signatures were examined specifically for relation to survival, even if not enriched?
* Discuss: how could sigs be used to guide treatment strategies?  What about early met markers -- why / how would the knowledge of early met markers be useful to treating the mets themselves?
* Expand discussion: applicability of pipeline to relapse and response.  Expand either here or in Ch 5.
* Increase rationale for choosing A2/A4 as segue to Ch3.
* Can a minimal geneset be suggested (down from 361)?
* Were attempts made to find the point of "no benefit" from surgery and build a binary classifier for prognosis around that endpoint?

Chapter 3:
* Better link to Ch2.
* Were attempts made to find the point of "no benefit" from surgery and build a binary classifier for prognosis around that endpoint?

Chapter 4:
* Add discussion on example biomarkers -- what are they, how could they be detected for validation, are they already known?
* Does A2/A4 arise in any analyses?
* Has any validation been attempted by IHC?

Chapter 5:
* Ch2: Should a similar analysis be done on mets?
* Ch2: How does genotype influence phenotype re: signatures?  In other words, would different sigs be expected for different genetic subtypes (eg. KRAS mut vs wt)
* Ch2: What about gene signatures in stroma?  What information could they provide on tumour-stroma interplay?
* Ch2: How does clonal heterogeneity interact with these signatures and methods?
* "Expansion on the application of the methods established in this chapter to other cancers (as touched on in the foreword)"
