Chapter 2:
* Discuss: how could sigs be used to guide treatment strategies?  What about early met markers -- why / how would the knowledge of early met markers be useful to treating the mets themselves?
* Expand discussion: applicability of pipeline to relapse and response.  Expand either here or in Ch 5.

Chapter 4:
* Does A2/A4 arise in any analyses?

Chapter 5:
* Ch2: Should a similar analysis be done on mets?
* Ch2: How does genotype influence phenotype re: signatures?  In other words, would different sigs be expected for different genetic subtypes (eg. KRAS mut vs wt)
* Ch2: What about gene signatures in stroma?  What information could they provide on tumour-stroma interplay?
* Ch2: How does clonal heterogeneity interact with these signatures and methods?
* "Expansion on the application of the methods established in this chapter to other cancers (as touched on in the foreword)"
