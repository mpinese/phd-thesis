Chapter 2:
* Add discussion on how filtering only on survival-associated genes could introduce bias and limit discovery of networks.
* Pg 27: How do results compare to histopathology (eg do high proliferation signature samples also have high Ki67, do high EMT have loss of Ecad?).  Discuss relevance to lab testing by IHC.
* Discuss: how could sigs be used to guide treatment strategies?  What about early met markers -- why / how would the knowledge of early met markers be useful to treating the mets themselves?
* Expand discussion: applicability of pipeline to relapse and response.  Expand either here or in Ch 5.
* Increase rationale for choosing A2/A4 as segue to Ch3.

Chapter 3:
* Better link to Ch2.

Chapter 4:
* Add discussion on example biomarkers -- what are they, how could they be detected for validation, are they already known?
* Does A2/A4 arise in any analyses?

Chapter 5:
* Ch2: Should a similar analysis be done on mets?
* Ch2: How does genotype influence phenotype re: signatures?  In other words, would different sigs be expected for different genetic subtypes (eg. KRAS mut vs wt)
* Ch2: What about gene signatures in stroma?  What information could they provide on tumour-stroma interplay?
* Ch2: How does clonal heterogeneity interact with these signatures and methods?
* "Expansion on the application of the methods established in this chapter to other cancers (as touched on in the foreword)"



Rebuttal:
Chapter 2:
* What other hallmark signatures were examined specifically for relation to survival, even if not enriched?  Not specifically examined, but done as part of MSigDB screen.



KRT6A	Epithelial marker
KRT6C	
ANGPTL4	Hypoxia marker.  Well known tumour marker w/ bio significance.  Angiogenic.  Protects from anoikis.  Disrupts endothelial junctions -> increases leakiness.
